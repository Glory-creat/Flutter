void main() {
  //loop in dart
  // A loop represents a set of instructions that must be repeated. In a loopâ€™s context, a repetition 
  // is termed as an iteration.

  // A loop in Dart is a control structure that 
  // allows you to repeatedly execute a block of 
  // code as long as a certain condition is met 
  // or for a specific number of iterations. 
  // There are mainly two types of loops in Dart: 
  // 'for' loops and 'while' loops.

  // 'for' loop //The for loop is used when you know the number of times you want to 
  //execute a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. 

  //Example

  //In the example below, the loop initializes 'i' to 0, 
  //checks if 'i' is less than 6, and increments 'i' by 1 in 
  //each iteration. The loop will run six times and print the message each time.
  for(var i = 0; i < 6; i++) { 
    print('Flutter/Dart');
  }

  int x = 19;
  for(int i = 2; i < 19; i++) { //implement loop control variable 'i' with 'i++'
    if(x == 19) {
      print(x);
    }
    x++;
  }

  //'While' loop //The while loop is used when you don't know the 
  //number of iterations beforehand, but you have a condition that should be met for the loop to continue. 
  
  //Here's an example:

  String text = 'two';
  int loop = 0; // initialize an integer variable index to 0. This variable will be used to access characters in the string.

  while(loop < text.length) {
    print(text[loop]);
    loop++;
  }


  //Do-While loop
  // The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees 
  //that the loop body will execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false. 
  
  String Text = 'two';
  int i = 0;

  do {
    print(Text);
    i++;
  } while (i > 8);
}
