  //Operators in dart

  // Dart, like many programming languages, supports a variety 
  // of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and values.

  //Here is a list of some common operators
  //1. Arithmetic operators
  //2. Equality and Rational operators
  //3. Type test operators
  //4. Bitwise operators
  //5. Logical operators

  //1. Arithmetic operators

  //Examples of Arithmetic operators are:

  // '+' (Addition)

   int x = 30;
   double y = 44.4;
  
   print(x + y); //Adding up the value of the 'int' and 'double,

  
  // '-' (Subtraction)

   int n = 50;
   double o = 44.4;

   print(n - o); //Subtracting the value of the 'int' and 'double,


  // '/' (Division)
    
    int g = 50;
    double s = 44.4;
  
    print(g / s + 44); //Dividing the value of the 'int' by 'double' + 44,


  // '*' (Multiplication)

    int k = 30;
    double q = 44.4;
  
    print(k * q);  //Multiplying the value of the 'int' and 'double,


  // '%' (Modulo, returns the remainder after division)

    int u = 30;
    double z = 2;

    print(u % z);  //Print to get remainder after division


  // '~/' (Integer division, return the integer part of the division result)
    int t = 30;
    double l = 2;

    print(t ~/ l);  //Print to get integer division
