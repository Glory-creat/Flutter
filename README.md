# Join me on my Dart/Flutter journey.
This repo is created to keep track of my flutter learning. I will be sharing EVERYTHING here.

#Day 0

# Day 1 dart learning(Variables and Types 1/4).
Today, I started my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language. 
Here are the key points I covered:
1. I learnt that Dart has various data types, including int, double, String, and bool, and I can use the var keyword for type inference.
2. I used the 'print' function to output information to the console, which is essential for debugging and displaying results.
3. Comments in Dart can be added using '//' for single-line comments and '/* */' for multi-line comment. Plus, Comments are useful for documenting code.
Here is the link to day one code (little) practice: https://github.com/Glory-creat/Flutter/blob/main/world.dart

# Day 2 dart learning(Variables and Types 2/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language(Variables and dart 2/3). 
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt about constant variables and final variables.
2. I learnt that the final variable is like a constant, but it's value is determined at runtime.
3. I learnt that mutable variables use the keyword 'var' or declaration as a prefix. Immutable variables use the key word final. Link to day two code practice will be posted in day 3.
