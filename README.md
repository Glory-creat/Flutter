# Join me on my Dart/Flutter journey.
This repo is created to keep track of my flutter learning. I will be sharing EVERYTHING here.

#Day 0

# Day 1 dart learning(Dart syntax basics 1/3).
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language. 
Here are the key points I covered:
1. I learnt that Dart has various data types, including int, double, String, and bool, and I can use the var keyword for type inference.
2. I used the 'print' function to output information to the console, which is essential for debugging and displaying results.
3. Comments in Dart can be added using '//' for single-line comments and '/* */' for multi-line comment. Plus, Comments are useful for documenting code.
Here is the link to day one code (little) practice: https://github.com/Glory-creat/Flutter/blob/main/world.dart

# Day 2 dart learning(Variables and Types 2/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language(Variables and dart 2/4). 
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt about constant variables and final variables.
2. I learnt that the final variable is like a constant, but it's value is determined at runtime.
3. 'const' variables are more efficient in terms of memory usage because their values are known at compile-time, while 'final' variables may have more flexibility but might consume slightly more memory.
4. I learnt that mutable variables use the keyword 'var' or declaration as a prefix. Immutable variables use the key word final. <Days/Day 2.dart>

# Day 3 dart learning(Variables and Types 3/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the constant and final variables.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I focused on understanding the constant and final variables I started learning in day 2.
2. I started learning about Null safety. No code.

# Day 4 dart learning (Variables and Types 4/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I did a little practice of what I have learnt so far from day one to 3.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt how to use the backslash in dart for escaping characters "\"
A quick example;
<!-- var object = '(\'it\'s correct\')'; //The purpose of the backslash to escape single quotes
  // var object2 = "it's correct"; //Using double quote does not affect escaping
  print('$object is correct'); //where "\" serves as an escape character -->

2. I learnt about Null safety; Nullable and Non-nullable types, Nullability annotations, and late variables.

# Day 5 dart learning (Collections and Null safety 1/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning about collections and Null safety.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt that collections are used to manage and store multiple values.
2. I learnt about the collection types in dart; 'List','Set' and 'Map'.

# Day 6 
On this day as I continued my journey of learning Dart,I focused writing practice code.

# Day 7

# Day 8 (Collections 2/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning more about collections.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learned about some of the functions and properties of the types of collections in dart
Code practice <Days/Day 8.dart>

# Day 9 (Collections 3/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning about 'Queue'.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learned about the collection 'Queue' <Days/Day 9.dart>

# Day 10 (Operations in dart
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning about the operations in dart.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learned about the operations in dart, the types of operations in that and their functions.
Code practice <Days/Day 10.dart>

# Day 11 (---) 

# Day 12 (Operations in dart)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I still focused on learning about the operations in dart.

# Day 13 (Loops in dart)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I still focused on learning about loops in Dart.

# Day 14 
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on collecting a few practice questions fron the internet(from resourses online)
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. For Day 15/16, I plan to practice all that I have covered from day one with some of the task practice I found online. As I do so, I hope to learn new things too.

# Day 15 (Decision making in dart 1/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning decision making in dart. Day 15 did not go as planned because most of the practice I planned to work on covered some topics I have not touched.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. Today, Day 15 I learned about decision in dart

# Day 16 (Decision making in dart 2/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning decision-making in Dart.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. Today, I learned about the 'if' statement. <Days/Day 16.dart>

# Day 17 (if, if else statement 3/3)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning decision-making(if, if else statement in dart) in Dart.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. Today, I learned more about the 'if' statement and the 'if else' statement. 

2. Code practice <Days/Day 17.dart>

# Day 18 (Conditional expressions)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning conditional expressions in Dart.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. Today, I learned more about the 'if-else' conditional expression
2. I did a small code practice <Days/Day 18.dart>

# Day 19 (Conditional expression)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning about Null -aware conditinal expressions
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. Code practice <Days/Day 19.dart>
