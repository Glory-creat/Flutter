# Join me on my Dart/Flutter journey.
This repo is created to keep track of my flutter learning. I will be sharing EVERYTHING here.

#Day 0

# Day 1 dart learning(Dart syntax basics 1/3).
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language. 
Here are the key points I covered:
1. I learnt that Dart has various data types, including int, double, String, and bool, and I can use the var keyword for type inference.
2. I used the 'print' function to output information to the console, which is essential for debugging and displaying results.
3. Comments in Dart can be added using '//' for single-line comments and '/* */' for multi-line comment. Plus, Comments are useful for documenting code.
Here is the link to day one code (little) practice: https://github.com/Glory-creat/Flutter/blob/main/world.dart

# Day 2 dart learning(Variables and Types 2/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language(Variables and dart 2/4). 
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt about constant variables and final variables.
2. I learnt that the final variable is like a constant, but it's value is determined at runtime.
3. 'const' variables are more efficient in terms of memory usage because their values are known at compile-time, while 'final' variables may have more flexibility but might consume slightly more memory.
4. I learnt that mutable variables use the keyword 'var' or declaration as a prefix. Immutable variables use the key word final. <Days/Day 2.dart>

# Day 3 dart learning(Variables and Types 3/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the constant and final variables.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I focused on understanding the constant and final variables I started learning in day 2.
2. I started learning about Null safety. No code.

# Day 4 dart learning (Variables and Types 4/4)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I did a little practice of what I have learnt so far from day one to 3.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt how to use the backslash in dart for escaping characters "\"
A quick example;
<!-- var object = '(\'it\'s correct\')'; //The purpose of the backslash to escape single quotes
  // var object2 = "it's correct"; //Using double quote does not affect escaping
  print('$object is correct'); //where "\" serves as an escape character -->

2. I learnt about Null safety; Nullable and Non-nullable types, Nullability annotations, and late variables.

# Day 5 dart learning (Collections and Null safety 1/2)
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on learning about collections and Null safety.
Here are some of the areas I covered:
1. I learnt that collections are used to manage and store multiple values.
2. I learnt about the collection types in dart; 'List','Set' and 'Map'.
