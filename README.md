# Day 1 dart learning(Dart syntax basics 1/3).
Today, I continued my journey of learning Dart, and I focused on understanding the basic syntax and structure of the language. 
Here are the key points I covered:
1. I learnt that Dart has various data types, including int, double, String, and bool, and I can use the var keyword for type inference.
4. I used the 'print' function to output information to the console, which is essential for debugging and displaying results.
5. Comments in Dart can be added using '//' for single-line comments and '/* */' for multi-line comment. Plus, Comments are useful for documenting code.
